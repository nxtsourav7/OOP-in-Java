# Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming

In object-oriented programming (OOP), a **class** and an **object** are fundamental concepts that help organize and structure software programs.

## Class
A **class** is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. Think of a class as a concept or a category of things.

## Object
An **object** is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. Each object can have unique values for its attributes but will share the structure and behavior defined by its class.

## Difference between Class and Object
| Object | Class |
|:----------|:----------|
| An object is a real world entity that is used for uniquie representation | A class is a collection of similar types of objects. Classes are composed of names, attributes, methods |
| An object is known as **"an instance of a class"**  | A class is known as **"a blueprint of an object"** |
| They are physical entities | They are logical entities |
| Objects are created using **"new"** keyword | Classes are created using **"class"** keyword |
| It consumes some memory space | It does not occupy any memory space |
| We can create objects as many times as we want | We can create a class only once |
