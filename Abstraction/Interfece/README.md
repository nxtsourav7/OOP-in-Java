## What is Interface ?
Interfaces are another method of implementing abstraction in Java. The key difference is that, by using interfaces, we can achieve 100% abstraction in Java classes. In Java or any other language, interfaces include both methods and variables but lack a method body. Apart from abstraction, interfaces can also be used to implement interfaces in Java.
